 * @title  Compliance
 * @notice Provides an interface for compliance checks.
 * @notice This contract is responsible for enforcing compliance rules for SecuritiesToken contracts and
 *         associated systems. It manages a per-token blocklist and
 *         a global sanctions list.
 *
 *         The sanctions list uses an epoch pattern: bumping `sanctionEpoch` in
 *         {setSanctionedAddresses} or {resetSanctionedAddresses} invalidates all previous
 *         sanctions in O(1) gas, regardless of how many addresses were previously sanctioned.
 *
 *         Role hierarchy:
 *          - DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE (Owner)
 *              ├── Manages grant/revoke of all roles
 *              └── Manages blocklist and sanctions list
